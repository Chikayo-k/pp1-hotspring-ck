        <p>
          The benefits of visiting a hot spring are wide and will have a different impact on everyone. Some of the
          main benefits are relaxation for both the body and the mind.<br>
          More specifically it promotes relaxation and healing in muscles from the heat of the hotspring. It helps
          improve the skin from the naturally occurring minerals that are brought up through the earth.<br>
          It improves circulation and relieves joint and inflammation pain. Works great for people with Arthritis or the
          elderly.<br>
          By allowing yourself to soak in the hot waters of the hot spring it can help bring about a sense of deep
          relaxation which can help both to reduce stress and improve mental health.

        <p>
          Have you decided where to spend your time in Japan?<br>
          When travelling to Japan staying in a Japanese-style hotel is one of the biggest recommendations we can
          give. Not only do many Japanese-style hotels have onsen within their facilities but they normally have big
          outdoor traditional style baths as well as small private ones for their guests to enjoy.
          Staying in a Japanese-style hotel, you can experience traditional customs and exceptional hospitality that
          have been honed over generations.
          Explore Japanese food in your room and enjoy simple tea services which will make your travel experience
          one to remember.
